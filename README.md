### What?

Loading comic content from my favorite web comics, uncluttered, in one page. Because lazy. This should never be under an IFD; Total and absolute respect for the content creators, especially Randall; By the way, his books are amazing. Go get them!

### Todo

* Latest? Random? Both? Aaaah
* Alright alright it (kind of) works. Refactor now
* Add more comics? Plug n' play with minimum customization to the regex / logic?
* Missing comics / numbers in URL numbering logic?

### (Talking to myself) So you did this to save a few clicks?

...That's a loaded question.
